Let's practically run the provided Kyverno policy and test it out real-time.

## âš¡ Installing Kyverno
 
Let's go ahead and install Kyverno using the below command 

```bash
cd ~/playground/
cp -r ~/s4cpcode/chapter5/5F/. ~/playground/
git status
git add .
git commit -m "installing kyverno"
git push
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Kyverno

Now that Kyverno has been installed let's also test it out by running a Deployment whose image is non-compliant.

```bash
cd ~/playground/
cp -r ~/s4cpcode/chapter5/5FF/. ~/playground/
git status
git add .
git commit -m "testing kyverno"
git push
