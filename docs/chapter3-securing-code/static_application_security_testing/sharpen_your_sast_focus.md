# Sharpen your SAST Focus

In today's digital landscape, automated source code scanning is indispensable for identifying vulnerabilities swiftly. Two key focuses in this realm are the detection of injection vulnerabilities and identifying dangerous functions.

**Injection Vulnerabilities:** üíâ
Automated scanning excels at identifying injection threats like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By analyzing code patterns, it swiftly spots potential injection points, enabling proactive remediation and safeguarding against these pervasive attacks.

**Identifying Dangerous Functions:** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Certain functions or APIs in code can pose security risks if mishandled. Automated scans pinpoint these risky functions, such as file operations or cryptographic functions, allowing developers to apply necessary security measures.

**Semgrep:**
Semgrep, an open-source tool, plays a pivotal role in automated scanning. It offers customizable rules and queries to identify specific vulnerabilities in code. With Semgrep, organizations can fine-tune their scans to target injection vulnerabilities and potentially risky functions, enhancing the precision of their security assessments.

In a nutshell, automated source code scanning, augmented by tools like Semgrep, is a linchpin of modern security. It quickly detects injection issues and dangerous function usage, fortifying applications against evolving security threats.
